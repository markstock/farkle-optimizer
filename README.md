Find the best strategy for playing Farkle

## Compile and run
On Linux, this should be as simple as

    make
    ./playfarkle

## Notes
The rules as programmed here are how I play with my family. Your rules, and the official rules, may differ.

## Thanks
Farkle is probably a trademark, and I am using it, and the rules here, without permission.
